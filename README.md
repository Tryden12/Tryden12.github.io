The purpose of this website is to present my resume. 

With the help of bootstrap, I was able to learn more about
JavaScript and customize everything to my choosing. 
I customized the javascript, images, styling, colors, fonts, and more!

I used my own color pallete. 

# Languages 
JavaScript 40%

# Custom Changes
As mentioned, this is a bootstrap site to begin with that was stripped down and rebuilt. 
I'm still utilizing initial bootstrap code, however, the only code left in there is
code I understand, code that is functional, or code than can be functional in the future (extra CSS classes).
